For instance, transition metals, Tantalum (Ta) and Zirconium (Zr),commonly form body-centred cubic crystals when supercooled. However,according to large-scale computer simulations, their crystallisation rates can differ by over lOO times.We reveal that this difference originates from stronger competing ordering effects in Ta than Zr. The key thermodynamic factor governing these kinetics is interfacial energy reduction through preordering in a supercooled liquid state. In Ta, strong competition between crystallisation and quasi-crystallisation occurs through non-classical pathways facilitated by crystal-like preordering and hierarchical icosahedral ordering. Conversely, Zr lacks this competing effect, leading to ultrafast crystallisation. These distinct features influence their glass-forming ability, potentially explaining the experimental synthesis of glassy Ta over other metals. Our findings provide insights into the formation mechanisms of glasses,crystals, and quasi-crystals of chemical elements. ",

To address this complexity,a more manageable approach is needed,one that simplifies the issue into a solvable form using a bottom-up approach. Based on our previous work9-1l，we have found that local chemical ordering,in combination with local topological ordering,plays a crucial role in determining GFA.Similar effects have been confirmed through extensive simulations of thousands of binary alloys12,13. In particular, simulations of a patchy particle model show that introducing noncompatible symmetric structures,like icosahedra,greatly enhances glass formation compared to having only crystaline orderings14. However,an excess of icosahedra may lead to quasi-crystallisation15. Unfortunately， the glass formation mechanism in multicomponent systems may be more intricate than anticipated, involving multiple factors，such as metastable phase competitions,selective crystallisation,and phase separation16.The independent role of local topological ordering, however,was not clearly understood.

More recently, the vitrification of FCC metals became possible through rapid deposition8，highlighting the importance of icosahedra-like topological orderings15.Despite these advances,the physical mechanisms behind glass formation in monatomic metals remain elusive,primarily due to the diffculty of tracking particle-level information.Unravelling these mechanisms is crucial. Furthermore,understanding the GFA of monatomic metals can provide valuable insights into the fundamental three-dimensional atomic configurations of glasses,as demonstrated in studies on high-entropy alloys with similar metallic radii9 and on single-component metals7.

Our analysis reveals a higher abundance of connected icosahedral order in Ta than in Zr，promoting the formation of a quasi-crystalline metastable phase (QCMP) that competes with BCC nucleation.This balanced competition between crystallisation and quasi-crystallisation in Ta occurs through non-classical pathways involving not only local orderings but also their hierarchical orderings.These findings clarify the role of local icosahedral orderin glass formation,crystallisation，and quasi-crystallisation of monatomic metals,with potential extrapolation to binary and multicomponent systems.The hierarchical nature of particle rearrangements during quasi-crystallisation offers insights into quasi-crystal properties, with potential relevance to other fields.

Briefly,we first calculated the free energy difference arising from the presence of liquid-solid interfaces at $T _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ using the free energy perturbation method.We then equilibrated a liquid-solid coexistence configuration with two planar interfaces at $T _ { \\mathrm { m } }$ and analysed their properties, including the number of atoms belonging to the interface and the interfacial area obtained from morphology analysis.From this approach,we estimated the interfacial energy $\\gamma ( T _ { \\mathfrak { m } } )$ as 1.182,1.162, and $1 . 4 9 5 \\mathrm { e V } / \\mathrm { n m } ^ { 2 }$ for BCC, $\\sigma \\mathrm { \\cdot }$ QCMP,and Al5-QCMP of Ta, respectively.

This observation suggests that the nucleus is effectively wetted by LiqICOs,which plays a key role in lowering the interfacial energy and facilitating quasi-crystallisation.

As a result, the BCC-Al5 interface remains relatively stable,and in our long-term simulations (up to $2 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { s } )$ ,no crystal growth occurs from either phase.

In our work，we present a microscopic understanding of how local structural ordersat different length scales play a role in crystallisation and glass formation. Our analysis also provides insights into the physical mechanisms behind quasi-crystal formation,which may extend to other complex phases as well.In fact, understanding the formation of MGs and quasi-crystals appears to be interconnected,offering valuable perspectives on the nature of MGs.

In contrast, such features are absent in Zr, whose total energy profile more closely resembles that of a typical Lennard-Jones potential.

Our analysis yielded the following findings: (1) $s _ { 6 } > 1 0$ is effective for identifying BCC particles,but not for other structures.Therefore,we use $s _ { 6 } > 1 0$ exclusively to assign atoms to the BCC phase. (2) $s _ { 1 2 } > 5 0$ can identify particles belonging to the $\\sigma$ phase, Al5 phase,or BCC phase.To distinguish between these,we combine $s _ { 1 2 } > 5 0$ with $s _ { 6 } \\leq 1 0$ to assign atoms to the QCMP $( \\sigma / \\mathsf { A } 1 5 $ phase). Next, we assess whether a particle exhibits icosahedral ordering by calculating $w _ { 6 }$ .To characterise crystal-like preordering，we group noncrystalline particles with $Q _ { 6 } > 0 . 2 5$ as follows: a particle is classified as belonging to a BCC-like crystal (PreBCC) if $W _ { 6 } > 0$ ,as FCC-like if $W _ { 6 } < 0$ and $W _ { 4 } < 0$ ,and as HCP-like if $W _ { 6 } < 0$ and ${ \\cal W } _ { 4 } > 0$ .These criteria have been validated in previous studies of single-component systems 44.
