Intriguingly the process takes place much more slowly in Ta, due to competing (quasi-)crystalline phases and the paper investigates the mechanisms behind this, specifically the order of icosahedral ordering in the supercooled liquid. The authors use classical nucleation theory as a starting point from which to analyse the reason for the difference in crystallization kinetics. It is clear that the differences in crystal growth rates, in self-diffusion in the liquid phase, and in the thermodynamic driving force are not sufficient to explain the observed differences. This leaves interfacial energy as the factor that must be responsible. Indeed, the role of icosahedrally ordered local environments is argued to be due to their effect on interfacial energy and not on particle dynamics within the supercooled liquid. The conclusions are that icosahedral ordering is crucial in Ta and leads to non-classical pathways involving local and hierarchical orderings, where hierarchical refers to the sequence atom- $\\mathrm { . > }$ icoshedra->quasicrystalline metastable phase (QCMP). In $Z \\mathbf { r }$ icosahedral ordering is only minimally present, and so crystallization to bcc proceeds without interference, though still in a nonclassical manner via so-called pre-ordering. ",

The field of metallic glasses began with the discovery of the first amorphous alloy, the Au-Si binary system, by Duwez et al. (Nature 187, 869 (1960)). Since then, progress has largely been driven by the discovery of new metallic glasses with larger sizes, culminating in the development of bulk metallc glasses. These advances have primarily relied on trial-and-error experiments to identify new alloy systems with enhanced GFA. However, the fundamental physical origin of GFA remains mysterious. This lack of understanding is a major constraint on the experimental fabrication of new bulk metallic glasses, a problem that has persisted in the field. ",

These parameters include topological order, chemical order， and their interactions (Hu & Tanaka, Sci. Adv. 6, eabd2928 (2020)). While some empirical rules have been proposed based on the properties of fabricated metallic glasses, they lack predictive power. To address this complex issue, we need to simplify it into a solvable form, taking a bottom-up approach. Based on our previous work (Hu & Tanaka, Sci. Adv. 6, eabd2928 (2020)), we found that local chemical ordering on top oflocal topological ordering plays a crucial role. However, the independent role of local topological ordering was not clear. This is why we turned to monatomic metals, where chemical ordering is absent, making it easier to define local topological ordering in a single-component system. Through this approach， we discovered that the balance between competing orderings is critical to GFA, and the competition between crystallization and quasicrystallization facilitates glass formation. This represents a novel contribution to the field and provides valuable insights that may also be applicable to other areas of study. ",

        "text": "2) The question of whether human beings can vitrify single-component systems is a fundamental one. It suggests that glass-forming ability (GFA） could be measurable for any material on Earth through the critical cooling rate, and it may also imply that the disordered state is a fundamental state for any materials, provided that the cooling rate is sufficiently fast. This is of great significance for advancing our understanding of natural science. Considerable efforts in literature over the past few decades have attempted to address this. For instance, the monatomic metal germanium (Ge) was vitrified by Angell et al. (Nature 448, 787 (2007)) under high pressure for a smallsample. While the origin of this phenomenon remains unclear, it is likely different from transition metals due to the involvement of directional bonding. Subsequently, Zhong et al. (Nature 512,177 (2014))demonstrated the vitrification of some BCC metals at an effective cooling rate of $1 0 ^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { K / s }$ , while FCC and HCP metals did not exhibit similar behaviour. More recently, Wang et al. (Nat. Mater. 23,1193 (2024)) reported the vitrification ofFCC metals through rapid deposition, highlighting the importance of icosahedral-like topological orderings.Despite these advances, the physical mechanisms behind glass formation in monatomic metals remain elusive, largely due to the difficulty in tracking particle-level information. Exploring these mechanisms is crucial. Furthermore, understanding the GFA of monatomic metals can offer important insights into the fundamental three-dimensional atomic packing structures of glasses, as seen in studies such as Miao et al. (Nature 592, 60, 2021) on high-entropy alloys with similar metallic radii, and in the work of Nat. Mater. 21, 95 (2022) on single-component metals. ",

One notable contribution by Keys & Glozter (PRL 99, 235503， 2007） proposed that dodecagonal quasicrystals form through the assimilation of stable icosahedral clusters.Despite this, the crystallization kinetics of quasicrystals in supercooled liquids and their competition with regular crystals are still not well understood. Our study provides answers to these fundamental questions, shedding light on the conditions under which quasicrystals can form.

However, this scope can be broadened to other fields where the origin of glassforming ability in monatomic metals remains unclear or has been overlooked. A prime example is antimony (Sb), a single-component phase change material identified by Salinga et al. (Nat. Mater. 17, 681(2018))[ref.4]. Its ability to rapidly switch between amorphous and crystalline states holds great potential for information storage. Another example involves the vitrification of active metals such as lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) through electrochemical deposition, which is crucial for the development of high-performance batteries (Wang et al. Nat. Mater. 19, 1339 (2020)). Both of these cases are of significant technological importance, but the structural mechanisms governing their crystallization kinetics and glass-forming ability are yet to be fully understood. We believe that our current study provides important insights that could advance the understanding of the glass-forming ability in these monatomic metals, ofering an exciting direction for future research to expand upon our findings.

In contrast, in $Z \\mathbf { r }$ crystallization occurs solely through the former pathway， with no quasi-crystallization.

This is also a well-known concept in the study of metallic glass formation. The structural distance or incompatibility between the liquid and the crystal, both in topological and chemical ordering,is one of the main factors that are commonly considered to promote glass formation. The idea that a complex atomic-scale reorganization for transitioning from liquid to crystalline structures is associated to a better glass-forming ability is, in our opinion, a rather classical view [A. Inoue et al., Glass Forming Ability of Alloys, J. Non-Crystalline Solids,1993; Y. Waseda, On the glass forming ability of liquid alloys, Science and Technology of Advanced Materials, 2008； J.F.Loffler, Metallic Glasses, Bulk,Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology，2003；A.L. Greer, Metallic glasses...on the threshold， Materials Today，2009]. Another highlighted result of the paper is that the study clarifies the role of icosahedral structures (ICOs) in glass formation, and that this can be extrapolated to understanding glass formation in binary and multicomponent systems. However, the presence of icosahedral ordering in liquids and its association to glass forming ability is a well-established idea since the beginning of the field [Kelton et al., First X-Ray Scattering Studies on Electrostatically Levitated Metallic Liquids: Demonstrated Influence ofLocal Icosahedral Order on the Nucleation Barrier, Phys.Rev.Lett. 90, 195504,2Oo3]. This again is related to the difference between liquid and crystal structures, which favors or hinders nucleation. The structural evolutions presented in the paper for Ta and Zr seem very specific to these systems and we do not see how they change the general view of the role of ICOs in metallic glass formation.

This finding aligns with our results, where we show that quasi-crystalline nuclei can be wetted by surrounding local icosahedral orderings, thereby reducing the structural gradient at the interface. However， this microscopic mechanism was not recognized in their experimental work. Additionally, they did not demonstrate that local icosahedral orderings can stabilize the liquid against crystallization, favouring glass formation as observed by Tang & Harrowell (Nat.

If crystallization prevails, the liquid tends to form a BCC structure, while if quasi-crystallization wins, the liquid tends to form the o/A15 phase.

The authors attribute the non-classical crystallization pathways to the effect of reduced interfacial energy between the liquid and certain phases.However, there is not any estimation of the interfacial energy between liquid Ta and liquid $Z \\mathbf { r }$ and the corresponding crystalline phases (A15, beta, BCC, HCP, FCC), so the statement of ‘low interfacial energy’ seems rather a qualitative consideration. It seems obvious that a higher level of mismatch between liquid and crystalline structures will increase the interfacial energy, but at the same time the thickness of the interface willalso contribute. It is not clear from the structural analysis in the paper why a thicker (more diffuse) interface with low structural mismatch should produce a lower interfacial energy than an interface with high structural mismatch but thinner. From the highly detailed analysis presented in the work, we think it could be possible to clearly define which atoms belong to the interface and calculate the interfacial energies and support the discussion. Is there any reason why this quantitative approach is not performed? ",

This gradient decreases with increasing interfacial thickness and decreasing structural contrast. Consequently， a thicker interface with reduced structural mismatch leads to a smaller gradient, thereby lowering the interfacial eergy.

As the two states have the same free energy at $T _ { m }$ , the additional free energy $\\Delta F ( T _ { m } )$ arises from the formation of the interfaces. The interfacial energy is thus estimated from $\\gamma ( T _ { m } ) = N _ { i } \\Delta F ( T _ { m } ) / A _ { i }$ ，where $N _ { i }$ represents the number of atoms on the interfaces and $A _ { i }$ denotes the interfacial area. Given the distinct structural characteristics of different phases, we considered particle-level and cluster-level information for the BCC phase and the QCMP phases. We visualized the interface meshes for these phases in Fig. R5. The estimated interfacial energy values of $\\gamma ( T _ { m } )$ is 1.182, 1.162, $1 . 4 9 5 \\mathrm { \\ e V / n m } ^ { 2 }$ for BCC, $\\sigma$ QCMP and A15-QCMP of Ta. The BCC phase of Zr has a lower value of $0 . 5 4 2 ~ \\mathrm { e V } / \\mathrm { n m } ^ { 2 }$ . This comparison aligns well with the above analysis from the crystallization kinetics.

In the revised manuscript, we have modified equation (3) [previously equation (2)] to directly express $\\tau _ { x t a l }$ rather than $I ,$ to be consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2b. Additional explanation has also been added for clarity. ",

All of these have been benchmarked against DFT and/or experiments by their respective developers.As can be seen, these potentials also exhibit non-smooth, rugged features in their pair interaction terms. This suggests that such ruggedness may not be an artifact, but rather reflects the complex nature of metallic bonding.
